/**
 * Installer migration: retire pi's stale `extensions/gsd.cjs` after #2470
 * renamed the installed native extension to `extensions/gsd.js`.
 *
 * What old artifact is being retired?
 *   `extensions/gsd.cjs` — the pre-#2470 dest filename for pi's native
 *   extension. pi auto-discovers extensions by scanning `<agentDir>/extensions/`
 *   and keeping only names accepted by its own predicate
 *   (`isExtensionFile()` in @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent:
 *   `name.endsWith(".ts") || name.endsWith(".js")`). A `.cjs` file is skipped
 *   SILENTLY — no `/gsd` command, no error, no log line. The file is therefore
 *   permanently inert, not merely redundant.
 *
 * How do we prove it is GSD-owned?
 *   The installer records the native plugin in the install manifest as
 *   `<nativePlugin.dir>/<nativePlugin.file>` (bin/install.js, the
 *   `_hostBehaviors(runtime).nativePlugin` manifest block), so a pre-#2470 pi
 *   install carries `extensions/gsd.cjs` as a manifest-managed entry. Only a
 *   manifest-managed classification produces an action here; an unmanifested
 *   `gsd.cjs` is treated as a user's own file and preserved.
 *
 * What happens if the user modified it?
 *   `backup-and-remove` instead of `remove-managed`, so a patched extension is
 *   recoverable from the backup rather than silently destroyed.
 *
 * What happens if it is missing?
 *   No actions — fresh (post-#2470) installs and already-migrated installs both
 *   plan empty, so the migration is idempotent.
 *
 * What runtime and scope does it affect?
 *   pi only, global and local. No other runtime ever installed this path:
 *   OpenCode and Kilo — the only other runtimes declaring
 *   `hostBehaviors.nativePlugin` — both ship `plugins/gsd-core.js`.
 *
 * Is the action safe in non-interactive install?
 *   Yes. Both emitted action types are non-interactive and journaled; neither
 *   requires a user choice, and unknown files never produce an action.
 *
 * Why not `move-managed`? The installer materializes the new `extensions/gsd.js`
 * from the package payload in the same run, so moving the stale file onto that
 * path would just be overwritten. Retiring the old path is the accurate
 * description of the change.
 *
 * See docs/installer-migrations.md#shipped-migrations and the pi row of
 * docs/installer-migrations.md#runtime-configuration-contract-registry.
