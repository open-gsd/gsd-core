/**
 * Arg redaction policy — issue #177 (ADR-457 build-at-publish: the
 * hand-written bin/lib/observability/redaction.cjs collapsed to a TypeScript
 * source of truth). Behaviour is preserved byte-for-behaviour from the prior
 * hand-written .cjs; only types are added.
 *
 * Privacy default: args are OMITTED from every emitted event (both stderr
 * and file audit). Opt-in: set GSD_AUDIT_ARGS=1 to include args verbatim.
 *
 * This module is deliberately simple and has no side effects — redaction
 * decisions are stateless reads of process.env at call time so that tests
 * can toggle the env var without module-level caching issues.
