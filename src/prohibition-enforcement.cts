/**
 * prohibition-enforcement — the deterministic PRODUCER for test-tier prohibition verification
 * (#1259, ADR-550 Decision 5d "heavy half"; the D1 seam — a NEW deterministic gsd-tools
 * sub-command, NOT free-form workflow prose).
 *
 * Today `dispositionForProhibition()` (src/probe-core.cts) already carries the POLICY seam: with
 * non-empty `enforcementEvidence` AND `tier === 'test'` it returns `{ status: 'green' }` (the
 * branch at probe-core 420-427); with empty evidence it fails closed to flagged-unverified. But
 * NOTHING in the live pipeline ever produced `enforcementEvidence`, so the green branch was
 * unreachable. This module is the missing producer: it LOCATES the wired mechanical check from a
 * check descriptor, RUNS it and requires a genuine NON-VACUOUS pass, builds a typed
 * `enforcementEvidence` array on PASS, and emits the `dispositionForProhibition` verdict as JSON.
 * The green/fail-closed policy itself is untouched (no src/probe-core.cts edit).
 *
 * Accepts BOTH wired-check kinds (ADR-550 D2): a `node --test` negative test OR a lint/AST rule
 * (e.g. the in-tree `local/no-source-grep` rule — the D4 dogfood anchor, run via the project flat
 * config so the plugin loads). A missing, non-attested, or genuinely-non-passing check hard-gates
 * (flagged, non-green) in BOTH interactive and autonomous modes (ADR-550 D4 / D3) — never a silent
 * green.
 *
 * FAIL-FIRST IS MACHINE-PROVEN (#1279): the producer no longer greens on caller attestation. The
 * green verdict requires the injectable prover (`proveFailFirst`, default `defaultProveFailFirst`) to
 * INDEPENDENTLY run the check against a known violation fixture and observe it go red, AND the runner
 * to observe a real non-vacuous pass: `passed = proof.provenFailFirst === true && run.passed === true`.
 * Caller attestation (`CheckDescriptor.failFirst`) is demoted to a non-authoritative hint kept only
 * for backward route-JSON shape — no path greens on it alone (FF-08). The proof method is recorded in
 * the evidence (`failFirstProof`, FF-07). This replaces the #1259 caller-attested red-first property
 * with machine proof, closing the gap the ADR-550 D5d note tracked as a follow-up.
 *
 * Authored as strict TypeScript (`src/prohibition-enforcement.cts`) and compiled by
 * `tsc -p tsconfig.build.json` (`npm run build:lib`) to the gitignored runtime artifact
 * `gsd-core/bin/lib/prohibition-enforcement.cjs`. Do NOT hand-write the `.cjs`; it is emitted.
 *
 * DETERMINISM SCOPE: the DECISION layer is pure/deterministic and no-LLM — given a `runCheck` result
 * the disposition is same-input-same-output and mutation-survivable, and the parse/filter helpers
 * (`parseNodeTestSummary`, `tapTestNames`, `eslintJsonHasRule`, `eslintHasFatalError`, …) are pure.
 * The DEFAULT REAL runner is NOT pure — it spawns `node --test` / eslint, so its result depends on the
 * environment (eslint version + flat config, node version, the target file). That is why the runner is
 * an injectable seam (`runCheck`): the contract is unit-tested against injected results, mirroring the
 * injectable I/O pattern in `runProbeCli` / `ProbeCliOptions`.

 * that pending signal on the floor and swallow the user's Ctrl-C entirely. Left installed it is a
 * no-op over an empty target set that re-raises to the default disposition, so behaviour with no check
 * running is unchanged.

 * `--test-isolation=process` (Node >= 22), so the direct child is a RUNNER that re-execs a per-file
 * WORKER, and the worker is what actually executes the subject. On timeout the runner is killed while
 * the worker is never signalled at all: it is reparented to PID 1 and, if the subject hangs, busy-loops
 * forever burning a core. The verdict still failed closed, so nothing observable broke — which is
 * exactly why this leaked unnoticed across days of green runs.
 *
 * So: `reapDescendants` in a `finally`, on every platform (see its comment for how each one reaches
 * the subtree). SIGKILL rather than SIGTERM on POSIX because a subject stuck in a tight loop blocks the
 * event loop, so a JS-level signal handler could never run — only an uncatchable signal is guaranteed
 * to land. The reap fires on every path where the child did NOT exit on its own — timeout, spawn
 * error, interrupt — which keeps the invariant testable: NO descendant of a bounded check survives the
 * call. A child that exited on its own is the one case skipped, because `spawnSync` has already waited
 * on it and there is nothing below it left to kill (see `reapNeeded`).
 *
 * Rejected alternative: `--test-isolation=none` forks no worker, so the direct child is the hanging
 * process and the existing kill would reach it. Measured, it is strictly WORSE — the subject then runs
 * inside the runner, whose SIGTERM queues behind the blocked event loop and is never processed, so the
 * bounded timeout stops working and verify hangs instead of failing closed.
