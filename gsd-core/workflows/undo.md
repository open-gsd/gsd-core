Parse the user's selection into COMMITS list.

---

**MODE=phase:**

Resolve the phase's own directory, then anchor the selection window on it. `find-phase`
resolves through `planningDir`, so under an active workstream this is that workstream's
phase directory — not the root's same-numbered one.

```bash
PHASE_DIR=$(gsd_run query find-phase "${TARGET_PHASE}" --raw 2>/dev/null)
```

If `PHASE_DIR` is empty, the phase does not exist in the active scope:
```
Phase ${TARGET_PHASE} not found in the active planning scope. Nothing to revert.
```
Exit cleanly — do NOT fall back to an unbounded search.

**Refuse an ARCHIVED resolution — it selects the wrong milestone, not merely too few
commits.** `find-phase` searches the live `phases/` directory first, then every
`milestones/v<X.Y>-phases/` directory in ascending version order, and its ambiguity check
is scoped to a *single* directory — it does not span them (`cmdFindPhase`, `src/phase.cts`:
the `matches.length > 1` test sits inside the per-`searchDir` loop). A phase number that is
not live therefore resolves **silently to the oldest archived milestone that has one**,
with no warning. Anchoring there is wrong in both directions at once: the oldest commit
adding that path is the archival **move**, so the phase's real work predates the window and
falls outside it, while the window runs forward from that archival through every later
milestone — where the subject grep matches *their* same-numbered phase. Driven on a
two-archived-milestone fixture, `--phase 03` selected v2.0's `feat(03-01): add search index`
and excluded v1.0's own `feat(03-01): implement auth endpoint`. Feeding that to
`git revert` is the cross-milestone contamination this workflow exists to close, so it
fails closed:

```bash
# Match the ARCHIVE LAYOUT, never the bare token `milestones`. cmdFindPhase only ever
# creates these dirs from /^v\d+.*-phases$/, so `v*-phases` is the discriminator -- and a
# bare `*/milestones/*` REFUSES A LIVE PHASE whenever a workstream or project is itself
# named `milestones` (driven: GSD_WORKSTREAM=milestones resolves
# `.planning/workstreams/milestones/phases/03-live`, which that pattern classifies as
# archived). Blanking PHASE_DIR is deliberate: the fail-closed rule below then also holds,
# so no path reaches selection even if this refusal's prose is not honored.

      # the shell-state residual below for what this scan does NOT survive.

    done

```

If `PHASE_DIR_ARCHIVED` is non-empty, stop — this message, not the not-found one:
```
Phase ${TARGET_PHASE} resolves to an ARCHIVED milestone directory (${PHASE_DIR_ARCHIVED}).
Refusing: the anchor there is the archival commit, so the window would span later
milestones and select their same-numbered phase instead of this one.
Use /gsd:undo --last N and select commits explicitly.
```
And if `PHASE_DIR_REUSED` is non-empty, stop with its own message:
```
Phase ${TARGET_PHASE} resolves to ${PHASE_DIR_LIVE}, but that directory name is also archived
at ${PHASE_DIR_REUSED}. Refusing: the first commit adding this path belongs to the earlier
occupant, so the window would open there and select that milestone's commits too.
Use /gsd:undo --last N and select commits explicitly.
```
Exit cleanly in both cases.

Derive the selection window from `PHASE_DIR` (the `#3995` anchor, shared with
`code-review.md`): the base is the parent of the first commit that added anything under
the phase's own directory, and the tip is `HEAD`.

```bash
PHASE_START=$(git log --format="%H" --diff-filter=A -- "${PHASE_DIR}" 2>/dev/null | tail -1)
UNDO_RANGE=""
if [ -n "$PHASE_START" ]; then
  if git rev-parse "${PHASE_START}^" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    UNDO_RANGE="${PHASE_START}^..HEAD"
  else
    # PHASE_START is the root commit — it has no parent to exclude. `${PHASE_START}..HEAD`
    # would drop PHASE_START ITSELF, refusing a legitimate revert of the first commit.
    UNDO_RANGE="HEAD"
  fi
fi
```

**Fail closed when no anchor resolves.** If `UNDO_RANGE` is empty, stop:
```
Cannot determine a reliable commit window for phase ${TARGET_PHASE} (no commit adds ${PHASE_DIR}).
Re-run with /gsd:undo --last N and select commits explicitly.
```
Exit cleanly. An unbounded repository-wide search is never the fallback — that is the
defect this anchor replaces.

Select within the window. **No `--all`:** only commits reachable from `HEAD` may be
reverted, because reverting a commit that is not in the current branch's history stages a
change the branch never received.

```bash
# `|| true`: grep exits 1 on no match. The former `| head -50` masked that rc; the empty
# case is handled by the Empty check step below, so the pipeline must not abort here.
git log --oneline --no-merges "${UNDO_RANGE}" | grep -E "\(0*${TARGET_PHASE}(-[0-9]+)?\):" || true
```

Use matching commits as COMMITS.

**Report truncation, never truncate silently.** If the selection exceeds 50 commits, show
the count and stop rather than capping — a partial phase revert leaves a worse tree state
than either reverting the phase or not:
```
Phase ${TARGET_PHASE} selects ${N} commits (>50). Refusing to revert a partial phase.
Use /gsd:undo --plan NN-MM per plan, or /gsd:undo --last N.
```

**MODE=plan:**

Extract the phase number from `TARGET_PLAN` (the `NN` of `NN-MM`) and derive the same
window from that phase's own directory — a plan number is unique within its phase, and a
phase number only within its milestone and workstream.

```bash

**Known residual — a revision range is ancestry, not chronology.** `PHASE_START^..HEAD`
excludes everything reachable from `PHASE_START^`, which is the right bound for the
ordinary linear case. It is not a *chronological* lower bound: a long-lived side branch
created before the phase, carrying matching scopes, and merged in **after** `PHASE_START`
is reachable from `HEAD` without being an ancestor of `PHASE_START^`, so it stays
selectable. This is strictly narrower than the unbounded search it replaces, not a new
exposure — but it is not zero.

**Known residual — a RENAMED phase directory under-selects.** The anchor is
`--diff-filter=A` on the phase directory's *current* path and does not follow renames, so
for a phase whose directory has since moved the oldest add at that path is the **move**
commit, and the phase's real work commits — which predate it — fall outside the window.
For a rename *within* the live `phases/` tree the failure is under-selection: the undo
reverts too little or refuses, never too much.

The **archival** case is not that case, and is no longer a residual — it is refused above.
It was previously documented here as under-selection only, which was wrong in the direction
that matters: the window runs forward from the archival commit, so while the target's own
work falls outside it, a *later* milestone's same-numbered phase falls inside and matches
the subject grep. Driven on a two-archived-milestone fixture it selected the wrong
milestone's commit and none of the right one's. Both modes now refuse an archived
`PHASE_DIR` outright; `/gsd:undo --last N` is the route for a phase that has been archived.

**Known residual — a phase directory introduced by a merge commit resolves no anchor.**
`git log --diff-filter=A -- "${PHASE_DIR}"` does not walk merge diffs by default. A phase
directory added on a side branch is still found, because the side-branch commit that added
it is itself in history; the uncovered case is a directory that first appears *in the merge
resolution itself*, which a **default** `git log` does not show: it suppresses merge diffs
unless asked (`-m` prints the add once per parent, so the information exists — the anchor
command simply does not request it). `PHASE_START` then resolves
empty and both modes fail closed on a legitimate phase. Safe-direction only — it refuses
rather than mis-selects — and untested: constructing the evil-merge fixture costs more than
the branch is worth while the failure mode is a refusal. `/gsd:undo --last N` is the route
if it is ever hit.

**A later milestone reusing BOTH the number and the slug is REFUSED, not a residual.** The
anchor is the *current path*, and `--diff-filter=A` does not follow renames, so re-creating
the same literal directory (`03-auth` again, not merely phase `03` again) makes the oldest add
at that path the **previous occupant's**. The archived refusal above cannot reach it —
`find-phase` returns the **live** directory, so nothing is under `milestones/` to refuse.
Driven before the guard: two milestones both using `.planning/phases/03-auth` anchored on the
v1 plan commit and selected all four v1+v2 phase-03 commits. The collision check closes it
without needing a phase identity a directory name does not carry: the same basename present
under an archived milestone means the path has been used before, so the anchor is untrustworthy
and both modes refuse. `code-review.md` carries the same weakness on the same anchor, where it
is read-only and merely widens a review scope; here it reverts, which is why this one is a
refusal rather than a note.

**Known residual — the reused-path scan assumes default shell options.** The collision check
is the only fence here that relies on **pathname expansion**; every other one uses `case`
patterns, which `set -f` does not affect. So a runtime that has disabled globbing skips the
scan silently and the refusal fails **open** on a genuine collision, and one with
`shopt -s failglob` aborts the fence on a *non*-match instead of passing. Both are outside the
shell state this workflow otherwise assumes, and neither is defended against here rather than
being hidden. Relatedly, the check is deliberately **conservative** at two edges: `[ -d ]`
follows symlinks, and an empty directory of the right name counts — either will refuse an undo
that a stricter ownership test might have allowed. Refusing too often costs a `--last N`;
refusing too rarely reverts another milestone's work.

**Known residual — concurrent workstreams.** The window above is scoped to the target
phase's own directory, which is workstream-correct, but the commit subjects it filters
are not: the executor's scope contract is `type({phase}-{plan})` with no workstream
token, so two workstreams running the same phase number concurrently emit
indistinguishable subjects and both fall inside each other's window. Narrowing the window plus the two
refusals above removes the unreachable-branch class entirely and every previous-milestone
route this workflow can detect — residual 2 is the one it cannot, since a merged side branch
is genuinely reachable from `HEAD`. This last class
needs a discriminator that does not exist in a commit subject today (`#3995`: *"Message
subjects demonstrably do not carry enough information to identify a phase"*). Until one
exists, `confirm_revert` is the backstop for it.

**Applies when MODE=phase or MODE=plan.**

Skip this step entirely for MODE=last.

Search for phases that list a dependency on the target phase. Look for patterns like:
- "Depends on: Phase ${TARGET_PHASE}"
- "Depends on: ${TARGET_PHASE}"
- "depends_on: [${TARGET_PHASE}]"

For each dependent phase N found:
1. Check if `${PLANNING_DIR}/phases/${N}-*/` directory exists
2. If directory exists, check for any PLAN.md or SUMMARY.md files inside it

If any downstream phase has started work, collect warnings:
```
⚠  Downstream dependency detected:
   Phase ${N} depends on Phase ${TARGET_PHASE} and has started work.
```

**MODE=plan:**

Extract the phase number from TARGET_PLAN (the NN part of NN-MM). Extract the plan number (the MM part).

Look for later plans in the same phase directory (`${PLANNING_DIR}/phases/${NN}-*/`, the
same workstream-resolved root). For each later plan (plans with number > MM):
1. Read the later plan's PLAN.md
2. Check if its `<files>` sections or `consumes` fields reference outputs from the target plan

If any later plan references the target plan's outputs, collect warnings:
```
⚠  Intra-phase dependency detected:
   Plan ${LATER_PLAN} in phase ${NN} references outputs from plan ${TARGET_PLAN}.

<success_criteria>
- [ ] Arguments parsed correctly for all three modes
- [ ] --phase mode anchors selection on the phase's own directory (find-phase -> PHASE_START), never a repository-wide commit-subject grep
- [ ] --phase and --plan modes fail closed when no anchor resolves, never widening to an unbounded search
- [ ] Dependency check warns when downstream phases have started (MODE=phase)
- [ ] Dependency check warns when later plans reference target plan outputs (MODE=plan)
- [ ] Dirty-tree guard aborts if working tree has uncommitted changes
- [ ] Confirmation gate shown before any revert execution
- [ ] Reverts use git revert --no-commit in reverse chronological order
- [ ] Single commit created after all reverts staged
- [ ] Error handling cleans up both first-call and mid-sequence conflict cases
- [ ] git reset --hard is NEVER used anywhere in this workflow
