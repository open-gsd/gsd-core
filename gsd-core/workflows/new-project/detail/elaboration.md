# new-project.md — deferred elaboration

Read in full when `workflow.compact_content` is `false` (the default) — see
`gsd-core/references/compact-content-gate.md` for the check and resolution rule this
spine defers to. Each `§` below is the full text the spine condenses at the point it
names.

## § 1 — Prior Spike/Sketch Detection (Step 2b)

Check for existing spike and sketch work that should inform project setup:

```bash
# Check for spike findings skill (project-local)
SPIKE_SKILL=$(ls ./.claude/skills/spike-findings-*/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null | head -1 || true)

# Check for sketch findings skill (project-local)
SKETCH_SKILL=$(ls ./.claude/skills/sketch-findings-*/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null | head -1 || true)

# Check for raw spikes/sketches in .planning/
HAS_SPIKES=$(ls .planning/spikes/MANIFEST.md 2>/dev/null)
HAS_SKETCHES=$(ls .planning/sketches/MANIFEST.md 2>/dev/null)
```

If any of these exist, surface them before questioning:

```
⚡ Prior exploration detected:
{if SPIKE_SKILL}  ✓ Spike findings skill: {path} — validated patterns from experiments
{if SKETCH_SKILL}  ✓ Sketch findings skill: {path} — validated design decisions
{if HAS_SPIKES && !SPIKE_SKILL}  ◆ Raw spikes in .planning/spikes/ — consider `/gsd:spike --wrap-up` to package findings
{if HAS_SKETCHES && !SKETCH_SKILL}  ◆ Raw sketches in .planning/sketches/ — consider `/gsd:sketch --wrap-up` to package findings

These findings will be incorporated into project context and available to planning agents.
```

If spike/sketch findings skills exist, read their SKILL.md files to inform the questioning phase — they contain validated patterns, constraints, and design decisions that should shape the project definition.

## § 2 — Research Decision: the four researcher prompts, synthesizer prompt, and self-heal steps

Spawn 4 parallel gsd-project-researcher agents with path references:

<!-- #2517 model-omit-on-inherit -->

> **Model omission (#2517).** Omit the `model` parameter entirely when the value it would carry (`researcher_model`, `synthesizer_model`, `roadmapper_model`) is `"inherit"` or empty. An empty value 404s on runtimes without native tier aliases — the default on non-Claude runtimes. Omitting it inherits the orchestrator's model. See @gsd-core/references/model-profile-resolution.md.

<!-- #2508 runtime-aware-dispatch -->

> **Runtime-aware dispatch (#2508 Phase 4).** GSD workflows dispatch specialized subagents by role. Before dispatching on a built-in-only runtime (kimi-code — three built-ins only), resolve the role to a built-in via `gsd_run query resolve-dispatch-type --requested <role> --raw`. On named-dispatch runtimes (Claude/OpenCode/…) the role is returned unchanged; on kimi-code it maps to `coder`/`explore`/`plan` by role-suffix. The persona rides `${AGENT_SKILLS_<ROLE>}` (Phase 3) regardless. See @gsd-core/references/runtime-aware-dispatch.md.

(The "wait for all 4 researchers before spawning the synthesizer" orchestrator rule, the full
synthesizer `Agent()` call, and the entire #222 self-heal recovery sequence — including its log
message and closing guarantee — are all stated verbatim in the spine. A pre-existing structural
drift guard (`tests/research-agent-profiles.test.cjs`) pins them there, so nothing about this
particular sub-flow is deferred to this file.)
