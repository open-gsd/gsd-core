# PRD Express Path — generate CONTEXT.md from a PRD

Runs when `--prd <filepath>` is provided (§3.5 of `plan-phase.md`).

1. Read the PRD file:
```bash
PRD_CONTENT=$(cat "$PRD_FILE" 2>/dev/null)
if [ -z "$PRD_CONTENT" ]; then
  echo "Error: PRD file not found: $PRD_FILE"
  exit 1
fi
```

2. Display banner:
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 GSD ► PRD EXPRESS PATH
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Using PRD: {PRD_FILE}
Generating CONTEXT.md from requirements...
```

3. Parse the PRD content and generate CONTEXT.md. The orchestrator should:
   - Extract all requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria, and constraints from the PRD
   - Map each to a locked decision (everything in the PRD is treated as a locked decision)
   - Identify any areas the PRD doesn't cover and mark as "Claude's Discretion"
   - **Extract canonical refs** from ROADMAP.md for this phase, plus any specs/ADRs referenced in the PRD — expand to full file paths (MANDATORY)
   - Create CONTEXT.md in the phase directory

4. Write CONTEXT.md:
```markdown
# Phase [X]: [Name] - Context

**Gathered:** [date]
**Status:** Ready for planning
**Source:** PRD Express Path ({PRD_FILE})

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

[Extracted from PRD — what this phase delivers]

</domain>

<decisions>
## Implementation Decisions

{For each requirement/story/criterion in the PRD:}
### [Category derived from content]
- [Requirement as locked decision]

### Claude's Discretion
[Areas not covered by PRD — implementation details, technical choices]

</decisions>

<canonical_refs>
## Canonical References

**Downstream agents MUST read these before planning or implementing.**

[MANDATORY. Extract from ROADMAP.md and any docs referenced in the PRD.
Use full relative paths. Group by topic area.]

### [Topic area]
- `path/to/spec-or-adr.md` — [What it decides/defines]

[If no external specs: "No external specs — requirements fully captured in decisions above"]

</canonical_refs>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

[Any specific references, examples, or concrete requirements from PRD]

</specifics>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

[Items in PRD explicitly marked as future/v2/out-of-scope]
[If none: "None — PRD covers phase scope"]

</deferred>

*Phase: XX-name*
*Context gathered: [date] via PRD Express Path*
```

5. Commit:
```bash
gsd_run query commit "docs(${padded_phase}): generate context from PRD" --files "${phase_dir}/${padded_phase}-CONTEXT.md"
```

6. Set `context_content` to the generated CONTEXT.md content and continue to step 5 (Handle Research).

**Effect:** This completely bypasses step 4 (Load CONTEXT.md) since we just created it. The rest of the workflow (research, planning, verification) proceeds normally with the PRD-derived context.
