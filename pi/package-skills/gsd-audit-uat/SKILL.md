Invoke this Pi skill with `/skill:gsd-audit-uat`.

**Pi host constraint (fail closed).** Pi has no subagent dispatch API. Any workflow step that spawns, delegates or dispatches a subagent — an `Agent(...)` or Task call, a `subagent_type`, "subagent spawns", or any named `gsd-*` role — cannot run here. When you reach one, STOP that step: tell the user which role it needs and that Pi cannot dispatch it yet (tracked in https://github.com/open-gsd/gsd-core/issues/5559). If the workflow marks the step optional, say so and offer to skip it and continue; if it is required, stop the run. Never execute the role's work inline as a substitute.

**Pi includes.** Pi does not expand `@path` references in a skill. Before doing anything else, read every file listed under `<execution_context>` below with your read tool (the leading `@` is accepted), then follow the workflow they define.


<objective>
Scan all phases for pending, skipped, blocked, and human_needed UAT items. Cross-reference against codebase to detect stale documentation. Produce prioritized human test plan.
