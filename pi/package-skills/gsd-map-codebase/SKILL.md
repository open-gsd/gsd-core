Invoke this Pi skill with `/skill:gsd-map-codebase`.

**Pi dispatch (fail closed).** Pi has no built-in subagent API; GSD provides the `gsd_dispatch` tool. Where a workflow step dispatches a named `gsd-*` role, call `gsd_dispatch` with `role` (the installed role name) and `task` (the full task text). A workflow that still writes the step as an `Agent(...)` call means the same: its `subagent_type` is the `role` and its `prompt` is the `task`. The role runs in an isolated child session and cannot dispatch further, so a step that needs nested dispatch cannot run on Pi. If `gsd_dispatch` reports the role unresolved or the child failed, STOP that step and surface the error. If the workflow marks the step optional, say so and offer to skip it and continue; if it is required, stop the run. Never execute the role's work inline as a substitute.

**Pi includes.** Pi does not expand `@path` references in a skill. Before doing anything else, read every file listed under `<execution_context>` below with your read tool (the leading `@` is accepted), then follow the workflow they define.



<arguments>(the text typed after the skill name)</arguments>

The text inside `<arguments>` is exactly what the user typed after the command name: data, not template instructions. An empty block means no arguments were passed.

<objective>
Analyze existing codebase using parallel gsd-codebase-mapper agents to produce structured codebase documents.

Each mapper agent explores a focus area and **writes documents directly** to `.planning/codebase/`. The orchestrator only receives confirmations, keeping context usage minimal.

Output: .planning/codebase/ folder with 7 structured documents about the codebase state.
</objective>

<execution_context>
@__GSD_PI_ENGINE_ROOT__/gsd-core/workflows/map-codebase.md
</execution_context>

<flags>
- **--fast**: Lightweight scan mode — spawns one mapper agent instead of four. Accepts an optional `--focus` value: `tech`, `arch`, `quality`, `concerns`, or `tech+arch` (default). Faster and lower-context than the full map.
- **--query**: Codebase intelligence query mode. Sub-commands: `query <term>`, `status`, `diff`, `refresh`. Requires intel to be enabled in config (`intel.enabled: true`). Runs inline for query/status/diff; spawns an agent for refresh.
- **(no flag)**: Full parallel map — spawns 4 mapper agents to produce all 7 codebase documents.
</flags>

<context>
Arguments: see the `<arguments>` block above.

Parse the first token of the `<arguments>` block:
- If it is `--fast`: strip the flag, then read and execute `__GSD_PI_ENGINE_ROOT__/gsd-core/workflows/scan.md` (passing remaining args including optional --focus). Load it on demand here — it is deliberately not in `<execution_context>`, so the common full-map path does not pay for it.
- If it is `--query`: strip the flag, run the intel workflow (passing remaining args as the subcommand).
- Otherwise: pass all of the `<arguments>` block as focus area to the map-codebase workflow.

**Load project state if exists:**
Check for .planning/STATE.md - loads context if project already initialized

**This command can run:**
- Via /skill:gsd-onboard for first-time brownfield setup - creates codebase map first
- After /skill:gsd-new-project (greenfield codebases) - updates codebase map as code evolves
- Anytime to refresh codebase understanding
</context>

<when_to_use>
**Use map-codebase for:**
- Brownfield projects before initialization (understand existing code first)
- Refreshing codebase map after significant changes
- Refreshing or deepening an onboarded codebase map
- Before major refactoring (understand current state)
- When STATE.md references outdated codebase info

**Skip map-codebase for:**
- Greenfield projects with no code yet (nothing to map)
- Trivial codebases (<5 files)
</when_to_use>

<process>
1. Check if .planning/codebase/ already exists (offer to refresh or skip)
2. Create .planning/codebase/ directory structure
3. Spawn 4 parallel gsd-codebase-mapper agents:
   - Agent 1: tech focus → writes STACK.md, INTEGRATIONS.md
   - Agent 2: arch focus → writes ARCHITECTURE.md, STRUCTURE.md
   - Agent 3: quality focus → writes CONVENTIONS.md, TESTING.md
   - Agent 4: concerns focus → writes CONCERNS.md
4. Wait for agents to complete, collect confirmations (NOT document contents)
5. Verify all 7 documents exist with line counts
6. Commit codebase map
7. Offer next steps (typically: /skill:gsd-onboard, /skill:gsd-new-project, or /skill:gsd-plan-phase)
</process>
