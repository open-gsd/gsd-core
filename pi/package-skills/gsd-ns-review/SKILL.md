Invoke this Pi skill with `/skill:gsd-ns-review`.

**Pi dispatch (fail closed).** Pi has no built-in subagent API; GSD provides the `gsd_dispatch` tool. Where a workflow step dispatches a named `gsd-*` role, call `gsd_dispatch` with `role` (the installed role name) and `task` (the full task text). A workflow that still writes the step as an `Agent(...)` call means the same: its `subagent_type` is the `role` and its `prompt` is the `task`. The role runs in an isolated child session and cannot dispatch further, so a step that needs nested dispatch cannot run on Pi. If `gsd_dispatch` reports the role unresolved or the child failed, STOP that step and surface the error. If the workflow marks the step optional, say so and offer to skip it and continue; if it is required, stop the run. Never execute the role's work inline as a substitute.

**Pi includes.** Pi does not expand `@path` references in a skill. Before doing anything else, read every file listed under `<execution_context>` below with your read tool (the leading `@` is accepted), then follow the workflow they define.
