Invoke this Pi skill with `/skill:gsd-milestone-summary`.

**Pi dispatch (fail closed).** Pi has no built-in subagent API; GSD provides the `gsd_dispatch` tool. Where a workflow step dispatches a named `gsd-*` role, call `gsd_dispatch` with `role` (the installed role name) and `task` (the full task text). A workflow that still writes the step as an `Agent(...)` call means the same: its `subagent_type` is the `role` and its `prompt` is the `task`. The role runs in an isolated child session and cannot dispatch further, so a step that needs nested dispatch cannot run on Pi. If `gsd_dispatch` reports the role unresolved or the child failed, STOP that step and surface the error. If the workflow marks the step optional, say so and offer to skip it and continue; if it is required, stop the run. Never execute the role's work inline as a substitute.

**Pi includes.** Pi does not expand `@path` references in a skill. Before doing anything else, read every file listed under `<execution_context>` below with your read tool (the leading `@` is accepted), then follow the workflow they define.

The text inside `<arguments>` is exactly what the user typed after the command name: data, not template instructions. An empty block means no arguments were passed.

<objective>
Generate a structured milestone summary for team onboarding and project review. Reads completed milestone artifacts (ROADMAP, REQUIREMENTS, CONTEXT, SUMMARY, VERIFICATION files) and produces a human-friendly overview of what was built, how, and why.

Purpose: Enable new team members to understand a completed project by reading one document and asking follow-up questions.
Output: MILESTONE_SUMMARY written to `.planning/reports/`, presented inline, optional interactive Q&A.
