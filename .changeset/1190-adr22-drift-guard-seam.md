**`gsd-tools drift-guard` — deterministic plan-drift severity/authority decisions (ADR-22).** The plan-review source-grounding pass now classifies cited-symbol drift through a tested seam (5-rung authority ladder, `grep`→`intel` auto-upgrade, severity mapping, rung≥3 hard-block) instead of re-deriving the rules from workflow prose on each run.
